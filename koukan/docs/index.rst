Koukan: Cloud-Native Email Transport
====================================

- Application developers want a batteries-included REST api that

  - handles every aspect of formatting and sending complex-structured emails
  - makes failures easier to handle than dealing with bounce messages
- SRE wants something that runs on k8s
- Everyone wants to be agnostic to SaaS vs on-prem/self-hosted
